1. On the first page, go through “Given”  and “To Discuss” information <br>
2. Click on “Existence” button to learn existence and “Uniqueness” button  to learn uniqueness of a linear map equation through the given diagrams <br>
3. Click on the “Next” button to go to the next page which provides an opportunity for hands on practice to find consistency of a linear map equation. Two linear map equations are given and new equations can be constructed by the user. <br>
4.First go through the given linear map and its range. <br>
5.For Equation one, click on “consistent” button if you feel the equation is consistent otherwise click on “Inconsistent”.<br>
6.For all solutions enter the values of p and q and click on “check answer” button to check whether (p, q) is a solution and the reason.<br>
7.Repeat the same process for  Equation two.<br>
8.Click on the “Construction of More Equations” button to practice with new equations.
