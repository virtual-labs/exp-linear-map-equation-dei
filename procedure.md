<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 22px;">1.	On the first page, go through the “Notation” section.<br>
2.	In the “Consistency (Existence of solution)” section, go through the diagram and choose the answer from the dropdown for each question and click on “Submit” button to check the answer.<br>
3.	In the “Uniqueness of solution (if the solution exists)” section, go through the diagram and select the answer from the dropdown and click on “Submit” button to check the answer.<br>
4.	Click on the “Next” button to go to the next page which provides an opportunity for hands on experience of working with linear map equations. .<br>
5.	In the very beginning a linear map together with its geometry is given. The linear map equations on this page are related to this linear map.<br>
6.	In Example 1 click on “Consistent” button if you feel the equation is consistent otherwise click on “Inconsistent” button. Thereafter, you will find “Solution” section, if the equation is consistent. Now enter the values of <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> and click on “Check Answer” button to check whether (<i>p, q</i>) is a solution. The reason is also provided.<br>
7.	Repeat the same process for Example 2.<br>
8.	In “More Examples (Construction of More Equations)” section, enter the values for <i>r</i> and <i>s</i> and click on “submit” button to get the new equation, its geometry and consistency.</span>
